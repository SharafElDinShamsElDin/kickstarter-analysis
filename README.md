# Kickstarter Projects Analysis

A machine learning project that analyzes Kickstarter project data to predict project success using TensorFlow.

## Overview

This project processes Kickstarter project data, performs feature engineering, and builds a neural network model to predict whether a project will be successful or failed.

## Project Structure

- `import numpy as np.py` - Main analysis and model training script
- `ks-projects-201801.csv` - Kickstarter projects dataset

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

Run the analysis script:

```bash
python "import numpy as np.py"
```

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering (temporal features extraction)
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Data normalization using StandardScaler
- Train-test split for model evaluation
